Opening a custom library

Having created our custom library, we can load it into another session of draw.io. Below we created a new diagram in Google Drive.  Let us now add the custom library we created in the previous section.

Select File -> Open library from -> Browser (since we saved the library in local Browser storage).

The Browser file picker appears, and we can see our custom library file.

Clicking the file causes the library symbol menu to appear.
