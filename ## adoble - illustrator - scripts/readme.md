If you have exported svg in inkscape oid, then there will be no Style element in the SVG file.

To have the ability in draw.io to change the collor of the scape, than this is needed.

This script allows for exporting all artboards in your document as SVG files.
Once the script is loaded you will be prompted to select a folder with your illustrator files
You will then be asked to select a folder where all of your exported files wish to live

Note: For this to work correctly, you must add and underscore to the end of your file name. E.g. MyFirstIcon_.svg

Note 2: Dont use the same directory as Source as Target !

# usage:

File -> Scripts -> Other Scripts (Ctrl + F12)
